Dataset:

Utilized the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset to analyze customer data.
Data Extraction:

Extracted and loaded the dataset from a zip file.
Data Preparation:

Selected key features: Age, Annual Income (k$), and Spending Score (1-100).
Scaled the features for improved clustering performance.
Determine Optimal Clusters:

Applied the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters by plotting the Within-Cluster Sum of Square (WCSS).
Model Training:

Fitted a K-means clustering model with the determined number of clusters.
Added cluster labels to the dataset.
Results Visualization:

Visualized the clusters and centroids to understand the customer segments.
Save Results:

Saved the clustered data to a CSV file for further analysis.

Results:

Optimal Number of Clusters: 5
Visualization: Clusters and centroids clearly identified.

This project showcases how K-means clustering can be used to segment customers into distinct groups based on their behavior, enabling more targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.
